# Price Optimisation based on price elasticity of Demand

Different strategies are used to price different types of products. Some products are very sensitive to changes in price—small adjustments can significantly affect how many are sold. Other products, like luxury items or essential goods such as certain medicines, don't see much change in sales based on their price. 

Price elasticity of demand (Epd), or simply elasticity, measures how the quantity demanded of a good changes in response to price changes. Generally, as prices increase, the demand for most goods decreases. However, the extent of this change can vary significantly across different products. For some goods, a small price increase can lead to a sharp decline in demand, while for others, demand remains relatively stable even with substantial price increases. Economists use elasticity to quantify this sensitivity. 

More precisely, price elasticity of demand indicates the percentage change in quantity demanded resulting from a one percent increase in price, assuming all other factors remain constant. This concept is crucial for understanding consumer behavior and making pricing decisions.

Mathematically speaking, the price elasticity of demand is defined to be the percentage change in quantity demanded, q,divided by the percentage change in price, p. The formula for the price elasticity (ǫ) is: $$e =

In this work, we shall look at the sales of the items of a cafe. This cafe sells burgers, coke, lemonade and coffee. As a data scientist, it is our task to figure out the optimal prices to set for these items. If the price is set too high, the sales will drop & the price is set to low, then the margins will decrease. What is the sweet spot that will give us the maximum profit?
